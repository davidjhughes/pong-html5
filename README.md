# pong-html5
Pong. In HTML5. This will probably be the best thing I ever write.

## Notes
- I didn't follow the tutorial exactly
- I found a couple bugs (Surprise!)
- Time to make this more robust.

## TODO
- ~~Fix Draw Net~~
- Create Start Screen
- Create Win Condition Screen
- Implement said screens
